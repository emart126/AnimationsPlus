# Wynn Extra Bends
Figura Animation Overhaul Avatar made particularly for Wynncraft.\
This Figura avatar makes any normal Minecraft player avatar have\
arm and leg limbs and adds numerous animations that replace\
the normal Minecraft animations. The avatar applies limbs to any\
skin and works for slim variants. This avatar also allows left handed\
users to play. This avatar was made using\
Figura versions 0.1.5b\
Now works with Minecraft version 1.21.4

### Multiplayer
If your playing with friends you will be able to see the full moveset across\
different players. Thanks to Figura's cloud capabilities features like idle\
animations and attacking animations are synced up albeit with a small server delay.\
If your trouble seeing your friends avatar, ensure to got to the Figura settings\
page, under the permissions tab set players to Max. Since this avatar is resource heavy\
it requires a high permission set. This may get fixed in a possible future version.

### Other Added Features (Figura Action Wheel)
The Figura action wheel has temporary taunt animations\
that will get future updates but animations are still\
in development.\
The second page allows you to change various avatar settings\
such as enabling/disabling weapon holstering, idle animations\
and swapping armor textures to use the old textures.

### Wynncraft DISCLAIMER
If your using the armor setting to change your current armor texture to the old\
version, be aware that this only works for existing old textured armor. New cosmetic armor\
textures and future ones will show a non existing texture if you chang to an old texture.

### Wynntils DISCLAIMER
If you are using the "Wynntils" mod, you will not be able to see spell actions.\
This is caused due to a Wynntils setting that's enabled. Simply go to the wynntils settings,\
search for "spell" keyword and under the Overlays section disable "Spell Inputs  Overlay".\
Make sure to apply settings to save the changes. You should now see spell actions.
